# (Ford go bike trip data)
## by (Wejdan Mangl)


## Dataset

> I've selected one of the provided datasets the bike trip data. The dataset is about the FordGoBike system and the rides in San Francisco Bay area. The data consist of 183412 rows and 16 columns.


## Summary of Findings

> Data exploration was divided into three parts Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate. My findings in the Univariate part, I noticed that most of the duration of the trip is less than one hour. The majority of users are subscribers and Males. Also, I found it interesting that the majority of bike users are not enrolled in the Share Program. I was not expected that most of the user's ages are 30 and above. However, I found it unusual to have ages 100 and above, so I plot the age using a boxplot and I found many outliers points.
My findings in the Bivariate, as we noticed before that the majority of users are a subscriber but the customer users have the longest trip duration. Also, after plotting the age distribution, users with age 21 have the longest trip duration. The trip duration is close between the Males and Females but the Female users have the longest durations. I was interested to visualize the age distribution by gender, user type, and the bike system. I noticed that the majority of females are younger than the Male. Also, the customer is younger than the subscriber. Also, after I plot the age with three different categorical variables, I found members with 34 age have the most trips regardless of the type, gender, and bike share. The three subplots support the previous findings, most trips are made by males, subscribers, and those who answered no to the bike share. Finally, I used the heatmap, I didn't find a strong correlation between the variables. I noticed a negative correlation between duration and age and a positive correlation between duration and birth year.
My findings in the Multivariate, I noticed that the majority of customer type are young and have the longest duration. It was interesting to see that members who didn't enroll in the bike share have the longest trips at younger ages.
